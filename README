rcat - concatenate raw sockets

rcat operates in one of two primary modes: connect mode and listen mode.

In connect mode, the *source* and *destination* arguments tell which
addresses to connect. Both arguments are required; source must be an
interface name (e.g. 'eth0'), but destination may be an adapter name or
a hardware address ('ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff' for broadcast).

In listen mode, specify an interface name to the *listen* option.

A simple data transfer. In one terminal emulator run (requires root
privileges):

	# rcat -l eth1 > data.out

Send data from another terminal:

	# rcat -s eth0 -d eth1 < data
